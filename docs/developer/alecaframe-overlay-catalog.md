# AlecaFrame Overlay Catalog

Snapshot: AlecaFrame 2.6.90, released June 30, 2026. Evidence comes from
official documentation and the matching packaged client prepared under ignored
`research/alecaframe/2.6.90/`.

| Surface | Local status |

| Relic rewards | Implemented |
| Relic recommendations | Implemented |
| Chat Riven analysis | Researched |
| Riven reroll comparison | Researched |
| Trade completion | Researched; needs authenticated Market support |

## Relic Rewards

Opens when a fissure presents reward choices.

Each card shows:

- item name, platinum value, and highest-value highlight;
- ducats;
- vaulted and favourite markers;
- crafted or mastered state;
- owned count and recipe requirement;
- other set components, their owned counts, and set value.

Footer may show account platinum and ducats. AlecaFrame can copy recognized
rewards and prices to clipboard.

Detection starts from Warframe `OutputDebugString` received through DBWIN.
`Got rewards` delays capture for UI stabilization, crops reward labels, runs
OCR, fuzzy-matches items, and batches item and set prices. Requiem rewards are
skipped by this snapshot.

The reference renderer records exact Flexbox/Grid structure, computed styles,
and content-dependent element positions:

```bash
make aleca-layout-setup
make reference-previews
```

## Relic Recommendations

Opens with the fissure relic chooser. It displays owned relics for the detected
era using filters and ordering from AlecaFrame's desktop relic planner.

Cards show:

- relic name, owned count, vaulted state, and favourite state;
- expected platinum and ducats;
- void traces and refresh progress.

`ThemedProjectionManager.lua: LoadingCompleteEnd` triggers a small era crop.
OCR identifies Lith, Meso, Neo, Axi, Requiem, or All. Recommendations come from
cached inventory and reward data; visible relic tiles are not individually
OCRed.

## Chat Riven Analysis

Opens after the user follows a Riven link in game chat. It shows:

- weapon and Riven names;
- positive and negative stats;
- per-stat roll quality and overall grade;
- similar Rivens with similarity, price, source, and links;
- known good positives and acceptable negatives.

`EE.log` identifies the detailed item dialog. AlecaFrame captures and OCRs the
Riven card. Interaction begins through the Overwolf hotkey.

## Riven Reroll Comparison

Opens while cycling a Riven. Left panel retains the old roll; right panel shows
the new roll. Both use the chat Riven stats, grades, comparisons, and price
model.

Selection, confirmation, completion, and close signals come from `EE.log`.
Before and after cards are OCRed. Both modes use the same packaged
`RivenOverlay` window.

## Trade Completion

Package-only interactive prompt. After a recognized trade, AlecaFrame matches
the other player and item against the connected Warframe Market account. It
can decrement or close a regular order, close a Riven auction, and submit
positive reputation. A countdown applies the default close action.

This requires Market authentication, current orders, and trade text parsed
from `EE.log`.

## TennoFinder Notification

Package-only six-second notification used by AlecaFrame's separate squad tool.
It handles joins, leaves, kicks, disbands, and messages, with optional sound.
It is positioned on the right edge near 80% of game height.

## Desktop Features

These are not contextual game overlays:

- Foundry, Inventory, Mastery Helper, Relic Planner, Riven Explorer, Stats,
  Trading Analytics, Market account management, and build tools;
- Windows and Discord notifications for world state, Market messages, and
  Riven sniper matches;
- main AlecaFrame, build, and TennoFinder windows.

## Market Account Features

AlecaFrame can:

- view and edit regular orders and Riven auctions;
- create buy or sell orders from inventory and set views;
- change price, quantity, visibility, and order state;
- copy ready-to-paste Market whispers;
- receive Market messages and online status;
- reconcile completed trades and leave reputation.

Public price lookup does not require an account. Authenticated order mutation
is a separate daemon capability with owner-only credentials and explicit user
actions.
